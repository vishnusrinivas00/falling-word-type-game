# falling-word-type-game
I have developed a game wherein words descend from the upper portion of the gaming container. The objective is to input the corresponding word via typing before it reaches the lower boundary of the container. Upon each instance of a word reaching the bottom of the container without being typed correctly, a decrement in the player's life count occurs. A total of three life points are allotted, and upon the exhaustion of these three points, the game concludes. Furthermore, each accurately typed word contributes 10 points to the player's score.
